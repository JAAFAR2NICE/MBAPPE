    <h2 class="heading">His Story in PSG</h2>
    <div class="w3-justify">
      <p>I arrived in Paris at 10:30 p.m. one night. When I arrived, I called Antero [Henrique, PSG sporting director] to inform him of my arrival. Mbappé scored twice in the final 10 minutes of PSG's 3-1 Ligue 1 win over Guingamp in his first appearance of the season. The following league game, the front three of Mbappé, Cavani, and Neymar all scored in a 3-1 win over Angers at home, with Mbappé scoring on a volley and setting up Neymar to score the third. On September 1, he scored and assisted in a 4-2 away win over Nîmes, but was sent off for the first time in his career in injury time after shoving Téji Savanier in retaliation for a late challenge from behind, for which Savanier was also sent off. Mbappé told reporters after the match about his dismissal: "If I could do it all over again, I would. I apologize to the supporters and to everyone, but this is unacceptable to me." Mbappé became the youngest player (19 years and 9 months) to score four goals in a 5-0 home victory over Lyon on October 8th.</p>

    <p> On August 31, 2017, Paris Saint-Germain announced the loan signing of Mbappé from Monaco. [46] A convincing speech by then-Paris coach Unai Emery at Mbappés' home in the summer, when Zidane was not guaranteeing the youngster a starting spot at Real Madrid (fresh from their 12th Champions League triumph) with an attacking trio of Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale, and Cristiano Ronaldo, was part of the tipping point. "I remember how strong Unai was, how good!" PSG scout Luis Ferrer told Le Parisien. He promised Kylian that he would play with him. And he kept his word. Unai had committed to playing Kylian even though he wasn't quite ready for a Champions League game. I returned to Paris one night.I arrived in Paris at 10:30 p.m. one night. I called Antero [Henrique, PSG sporting director] when I arrived to give him an update, and he was surprised that I hadn't stayed in the south. I took the first flight the next day at six o'clock. I rang the Mbappés' doorbell with croissants two hours later.</p>

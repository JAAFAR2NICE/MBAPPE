    <p> Mbappé was signed by Leonardo Jardim in October 2015 to be a mainstay in Monaco's B-team, but his level of skill and maturity prompted his promotion to the main squad after only three weeks. Two months later, on 2 December 2015, he made his first team debut in a 1-1 Ligue 1 home draw against Caen, replacing Fábio Coentro after 88 minutes. He thus became Monaco's youngest-ever first-team player at the age of 16 years and 347 days, breaking Thierry Henry's 21-year-old record.On 20 February 2016, Mbappé scored his first goal for the club's first team, a stoppage-time goal in a 3-1 home Ligue 1 win over Troyes; at the age of 17 years and 62 days, he became Monaco's youngest first team goalscorer, displacing Henry once again. Mbappé signed his first professional contract on March 6, 2016, a three-year deal that will keep him in Monaco until June 2019.</p>
